    <h3>History & Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
    Truth lives on through the works of the authors and spiritual pioneers that we study: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Judge Thomas Troward, and Emma Curtis Hopkins.
     <br /><br />
    You will also delve into the writings of Dr. Ernest Holmes. His love of people, and his facility for seeing past their problems into the heart of their eternal being, blends modern psychology with humankindâ€™s limitless ability to choose what to think and to feel, and therefore make changes in their lives.
